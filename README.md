# Signed Social networks analysis

Signed Social networks can be seen as a special case of Social networks, that maps each link with a sign. A link can be positive (+, 1, +1 etc) and that
represent that two nodes are friends, on the other hand a negative link (-, -1 etc) represents that the two connected nodes are foes. 

In this project, written for an intro in Social networks course at the Faculty of Sciences, Novi Sad, Serbia, the main function that can be seen in 
<b>klasterabilnost.py</b>. There we check if a given network can be partitioned into clussters where inter links are negative and intro are positive. There are other functions as well.
